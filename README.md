h1. Shopify API Integration Guide

h2. Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to integrating the Shopify API with your application. It outlines the key user stories, authentication requirements, API endpoints, and error handling strategies. The guide is formatted for Jira Confluence compatibility.

h2. Prerequisites
Before integrating with the Shopify API, ensure you have:
- A Shopify store with admin access
- A Shopify Partner account (if building a private app)
- API credentials (Access Token, API Key, and Secret Key)
- Understanding of RESTful API and GraphQL (optional but recommended)
- Development environment with an HTTP client (Postman, cURL, or equivalent)

h2. Authentication
Shopify API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You must generate an API key and secret key through the Shopify Admin panel.

*Steps to authenticate:*
1. Register your app in the Shopify Partner Dashboard.
2. Obtain API credentials.
3. Generate an access token via OAuth.
4. Use the access token to authenticate API requests.

*Example API Request:*
```bash
curl -X GET "https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/orders.json" \
-H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: {access_token}" 
```

h2. User Stories

| # | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Pass/Fail | Results |
|---|-----------|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Retrieve All Products | The API must return all active products in JSON format. Each product must include title, price, stock quantity, and description. | | |
| 2 | Create a New Product | The API must accept product details and create a new entry in Shopify. The response must contain the created product's unique ID. | | |
| 3 | Retrieve Customer Information | The API must return customer details, including name, email, and purchase history. | | |
| 4 | Update Inventory Levels | The API must update inventory levels accurately for specified products and locations. | | |
| 5 | Process an Order | The API must retrieve and process orders, providing necessary details for fulfillment. | | |
| 6 | Generate a Discount Code | The API must allow for the creation of discount codes with customizable parameters. | | |

h2. API Endpoints & Examples

*Retrieve All Products:*
```http
GET /admin/api/2024-01/products.json
```

*Create a New Product:*
```http
POST /admin/api/2024-01/products.json
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "product": {
    "title": "New Product",
    "body_html": "<strong>Great product!</strong>",
    "vendor": "My Brand",
    "product_type": "Clothing",
    "variants": [{
      "price": "29.99",
      "sku": "12345"
    }]
  }
}
```

*Retrieve Customer Information:*
```http
GET /admin/api/2024-01/customers/{customer_id}.json
```

*Update Inventory Levels:*
```http
POST /admin/api/2024-01/inventory_levels/set.json
{
  "location_id": 12345678,
  "inventory_item_id": 987654321,
  "available": 50
}
```

*Process an Order:*
```http
GET /admin/api/2024-01/orders/{order_id}.json
```

*Generate a Discount Code:*
```http
POST /admin/api/2024-01/price_rules.json
{
  "price_rule": {
    "title": "SUMMER20",
    "value_type": "percentage",
    "value": "20.0",
    "target_type": "line_item",
    "target_selection": "all",
    "allocation_method": "across",
    "customer_selection": "all"
  }
}
```

h2. Error Handling
The Shopify API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure. Below are some common error responses:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 200 OK | Successful request |
| 201 Created | Resource successfully created |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or incorrect API key |
| 403 Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Shopify server issue |

h2. Best Practices
- Always use **rate limiting** to avoid exceeding API limits.
- Secure API keys and never expose them in client-side code.
- Utilize **webhooks** to receive real-time updates.
- Implement **retry logic** for handling temporary failures.
- Keep API versioning in mind; Shopify updates versions every quarter.

h2. Final Evaluation & Approval
After completing the API integration tests, the following table provides a summary for DevOps engineering approval:

| Test Case | Pass/Fail | Comments |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Retrieve All Products | | |
| Create a New Product | | |
| Retrieve Customer Information | | |
| Update Inventory Levels | | |
| Process an Order | | |
| Generate a Discount Code | | |

*Recommendation:* Based on the above test results, the API integration is either **approved** for deployment or **requires further investigation** before approval.

h2. Conclusion
This guide outlines the Shopify API integration process with six core user stories. By following these steps, developers can effectively integrate and manage Shopify store operations programmatically.
